# Algorithm Project

This repository contains various C++ programs implementing different algorithms. The purpose of these programs is to provide examples and solutions for various algorithmic problems.

## Files

### `55.cpp`

This file implements a doubly linked list with functions to delete a node, add a node at the beginning, and print the list. The `main` function demonstrates creating a doubly linked list, deleting nodes, and printing the modified list.

### `Q2.cpp`

This file implements a stack with a feature to find and remove the middle element in O(1) time. The stack is implemented using a doubly linked list, and the middle element is maintained using a pointer. The `main` function demonstrates various stack operations like push, pop, findMiddle, and removeMiddle.

### `Q3.cpp`

This file provides an implementation of a stack that supports basic stack operations (push, pop) along with an operation to find the middle element in the stack. The stack is implemented using a doubly linked list to facilitate O(1) time complexity for finding the middle element.

### `Q4.cpp`

This file contains an implementation of a function to delete the middle element of a stack. The stack is implemented using a linked list, and the middle element is maintained and updated during push and pop operations to ensure O(1) time complexity for deletion.

### `new_Q1.cpp`

This file implements a stack data structure with an added feature of removing the middle element in O(1) time. The stack is managed using a doubly linked list, and a pointer is maintained to track the middle element.

### `test2_5.cpp`

This file contains a C++ implementation that includes various functions for stack operations. It focuses on maintaining the middle element and supports push, pop, findMiddle, and removeMiddle operations in O(1) time.

### `test_5.cpp`

This file demonstrates a stack implementation where the middle element can be found and removed in O(1) time. The stack is implemented using a doubly linked list, and operations are managed to keep track of the middle element efficiently.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run these programs, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)

## Building

To compile any of the C++ source files, use the following command:

```sh
g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
